        <h6>Great mashed potatoes</h6>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 large russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced shallots</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Poke holes into potatoes using a knife. Wrap each potato in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are very tender and easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let potatoes cool to room temperature. Unwrap and place on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Leave skin on potatoes. Use a cheese grater to shred potatoes into a large bowl. Add shallots to potatoes; season with salt, white pepper, and cayenne. Toss with two forks until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add Cheddar cheese and mix well. Gently toss in sour cream until barely combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish, piling it up high, then patting it down very lightly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and the top is browned, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>You can use 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons fine salt in place of the kosher salt. Ground black pepper can be used instead of white.</p>
            <p>If you do use shallots, note that a little will go a long way because they go in raw. Feel free to saute them in a little butter to take off the sharp, raw edge. Besides shallots, some thinly sliced green onions would be great, as would sauteed leeks, or even just finely minced yellow onions.</p>
